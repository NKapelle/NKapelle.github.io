Welcome! I am a quantitative Sociologist and Social Demographer at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I am also an affiliated Research Fellow at Nuffield College, the University of Oxford, and the Life Course Centre at the University of Queensland. 

I obtained my PhD in Sociology, Demography, and Statistics at the Institute for Social Science Research at the University of Queensland, Australia, on 9th November 2020. My thesis [“May your wealth be easily divisible by two”](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/data/UQ_e712149/s4224642_phd_thesis.pdf?Expires=1668267778&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKNBJ4MJBJNC6NLQ&Signature=OhnstB6hD4VfYCpHT72npMVfMIAm7AdWrXUknvDCYjin0ALXT69BiC5U61Gy07PzBniByrvkEnzGp2XKKqKQQ2QEgsCXKG-ozhLQpm5vpOBKDeT75tfPYajHjlmAfWJIAyaF0Hie70v6~vDJKlyEcYAh56JHt5tBhNgj8iyOUGHpvvl7U2tqVS7a4JA-XbuoKBaB0WbVPolw089K2ccjxqQ3bGldONz6oSmwiSNflJYjKgdrkMx-iD~r3c8akvYNDqKfUX9h9iKDVNUhEMnEdABea91J8jr2HQLPcTiuJJ~BfA~4GjbH2QBE-RVAok89AgVxC1ivcQhj~ibSqoi2zw__) examined the association between marital dissolution and women’s and men’s personal wealth using a life course perspective. Prior to joining Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in November 2022 as a Teaching and Research Fellow, I also held positions as Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford (2021-2022) and as Predoctoral Research Fellow at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (2018-2021) and at University of Cologne (2017-2018).

Using predominantly household panel survey data and longitudinal data analysis methods, my research focuses on the causes and consequences of social inequalities over and between life courses of individuals with a particular focus on subjective and economic wellbeing, gender, work, and the family.

My research has been published in journals such as the *European Sociological Review*, *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *European Journal of Population*, and *International Journal of Social Research Methodology*.
