I am a quantitative Sociologist and Social Demographer at Humboldt-Universität (HU) zu Berlin within the team of [Prof. Anette Fasang](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/mikrosoziologie-en/research-team/anettefasang) at her chair of [Microsociology](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/mikrosoziologie-en). <!---I am also an affiliated Research Fellow at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/), the University of Oxford, and the [Life Course Centre](https://lifecoursecentre.org.au/), the University of Queensland (UQ).--> 

I obtained my PhD in Sociology, Demography, and Statistics at the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.uq.edu.au/) (ISSR) at the University of Queensland, Australia, on 9th November 2020. My thesis [May your wealth be easily divisible by two](/files/phd_thesis.pdf) examined the association between marital dissolution and women’s and men’s personal wealth using a life course perspective. Prior to joining Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in November 2022 as a Research and Teaching Fellow, I also held positions as Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford (2021-2022) under [Prof. Christiaan Monden](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/christiaan-monden) and as Predoctoral Research Fellow within the [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng) project of [Prof. Philipp Lersch](https://pmlersch.github.io/) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (2018-2021) and at University of Cologne (2017-2018).

Using predominantly household panel survey data and longitudinal data analysis methods, my research focuses on the causes and consequences of social inequalities over and between life courses of individuals with a particular focus on subjective and economic well-being, gender, work, and the family.

My research has been published in journals such as the *European Sociological Review*, *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *European Journal of Population*, and *International Journal of Social Research Methodology*.
