Welcome! I am a Sociologist and Social Demographer at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I am also an affiliated Research Fellow at Nuffield College, the University of Oxford, and the Life Course Centre at the University of Queensland. 

I obtained my PhD in Sociology, Demography, and Statistics at the Institute for Social Science Research at the University of Queensland, Australia, on 9th November 2020. My thesis “May your wealth be easily divisible by two” examined the association between marital dissolution and women’s and men’s personal wealth using a life course perspective. Prior to joining Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in November 2022 as a Teaching and Research Fellow, I also held positions as Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford (2021-2022) and as Predoctoral Research Fellow at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (2018-2021) and at University of Cologne (2017-2018).

Using predominantly household panel survey data and longitudinal data analysis methods, my research focuses on the causes and consequences of social inequalities over and between life courses of individuals with a particular focus on subjective and economic wellbeing, gender, work, and the family.

My research has been published in journals such as the *European Sociological Review*, *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *European Journal of Population*, and *International Journal of Social Research Methodology*.
