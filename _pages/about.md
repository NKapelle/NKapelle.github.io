I am a Quantitative Sociologist and Social Demographer based at Trinity College Dublin, where I work as an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Sociology of Inequality and Life Course in the [Department of Sociology](https://www.tcd.ie/sociology/). I am also an affiliated Research Fellow at Humboldt-Universität (HU) zu Berlin within the team of [Prof. Anette Fasang](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/mikrosoziologie-en/research-team/anettefasang) at her chair of [Microsociology](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/mikrosoziologie-en), and at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) at [the University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of social inequalities across individuals’ life courses, with a particular emphasis on subjective and economic well-being, gender, work, health behaviors, and family dynamics. I use household panel survey data and longitudinal analysis methods to explore these issues. My work has been published in journals such as *European Sociological Review*, *Journal of Marriage and Family*, *European Journal of Population*, *Journal of Health and Social Behavior*, *The Journals of Gerontology*, *European Societies* and *International Journal of Social Research Methodology*.


I obtained my PhD in Sociology, Demography, and Statistics from the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.uq.edu.au/) (ISSR) at the University of Queensland, Australia, on 9th November 2020, supervised by [Prof. Janeen Baxter](https://issr.uq.edu.au/profile/887/janeen-baxter), [Prof. Sergi Vidal](https://vidalsergi.wordpress.com/), and [Prof. Philipp Lersch](https://pmlersch.github.io/). My thesis, [May your wealth be easily divisible by two](/files/phd_thesis.pdf), examined the association between marital dissolution and personal wealth from a life course perspective. 

Before joining Trinity College Dublin in September 2024, I also held positions as Lecturer at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (2022-2024) within the team of [Prof. Anette Fasang](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/mikrosoziologie-en/research-team/anettefasang),, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford (2021-2022) under [Prof. Christiaan Monden](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/christiaan-monden), and a Predoctoral Research Fellow within the [MyWealth](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/sozpolsoz/research/mywealth_eng) project led by [Prof. Philipp Lersch](https://pmlersch.github.io/) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (2018-2021) and the University of Cologne (2017-2018).
